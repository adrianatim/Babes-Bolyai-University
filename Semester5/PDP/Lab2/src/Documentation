Classes:
Main - contains only the method main and inside it we initialize 2 threads, one is supposed to produce and one to consume
ProducerConsumer - contain 3 methods:
            1. generateVectors() where it generates random numbers for no. of times and put them in 2 different lists
            2. produce() - takes the first value from each vector,
                           it will multiply them,
                           and then the result will be added to a queue
                           notify the other threads to wake them up
            3. consume() - take the value from the queue and add it to a global variable which increases each time
